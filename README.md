# My Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio repository! This meticulously organized collection serves as a chronicle of my journey in the captivating field of data science. Within these digital walls, you will find a curated showcase of my progression, featuring detailed and well-crafted code implementations, as well as comprehensive analytical reports.

## What to Expect

1. **Structured Codebase:**
   Dive into a neatly organized codebase that reflects both elegance and functionality. 

2. **Insightful Reports:**
   Explore detailed reports that accompany the code. Unpack the story behind the algorithms, understand the nuances, and witness the magic unfold.

## Machine Learnings Algorithms that has been explored

- **Linear Regression:**  Predicts a continuous outcome based on one or more predictor variables. Useful when exploring the relationship between independent and dependent variables, allowing for predictions of quantitative values, such as sales forecasts or temperature predictions.
- **Logistic Regression:**  Used for binary classification problems, predicting the probability of an event. Useful in scenarios where the outcome is categorical, such as spam detection or medical diagnosis, providing a probability score for each class.
- **Decision Trees:**  Tree-like models that make decisions based on input features. Useful for both classification and regression tasks, decision trees are interpretable and offer insights into feature importance, making them valuable in scenarios like credit scoring or customer churn prediction.
